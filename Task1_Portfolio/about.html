                <p>Hello, my name is Tanazza Muskan Mirza. I am currently in my third year of a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) program in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.<br>
<br>With a solid foundation in computer science principles, I have developed a keen interest in AI and ML.<br>
<br>I possess basic proficiency in web development, Python, and C++, and am continuously enhancing my skills through hands-on projects and coursework.<br>
<br>Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for creativity. I enjoy painting and reading a wide variety of books, which not only help me unwind but also inspire fresh perspectives in problem-solving.<br>
<br>I'm also interested in exploring niche topics and conducting in-depth research to deepen my understanding. I also find great joy in being outdoors, appreciating nature, and engaging in challenging puzzles and problem-solving activities.<br>
<br>I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow both professionally and personally, aiming to apply my technical skills in meaningful ways that contribute to real-world solutions. </p>
